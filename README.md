Thanks, M!

This program demonstrates how to use LibCtru to do graphics alongside SDL driving audio.

Here's a screenshot of an older version of this program which runs on the bottom screen:

The current version runs in 400x240 on the top screen.


This is a gif of the effect in a PC version of the demo,
found in my CGL repository.
The effect does not run quite this well on the 3DS, unfortunately.
